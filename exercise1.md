## CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice that involves integrating changes from multiple developers into a shared repository as frequently as possible. **CI helps to ensure the quality, reliability, and consistency of the code base, and to detect and fix errors early.**

### Some common steps in a CI setup include:

- Linting: This is the process of checking the code for syntax errors, formatting issues, and coding standards violations.

- Testing: This is the process of verifying the functionality, performance, and correctness of the code.

- Building: This is the process of compiling, packaging, and deploying the code. Building helps to transform the code into an executable or distributable form, and to prepare it for delivery or release.

### There are various tools that can help us with these steps when building an application in Java. Some of the popular and widely used tools are:

- Maven

- Jenkins

- SonarQube

### Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are many other tools that can help us set up the CI for our project. Some of the popular and widely used tools are:

- CircleCI

- Travis CI

- GitLab CI

- Azure DevOps

- CodeShip

### The choice between a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment for our CI setup depends on various factors, such as our budget, security, scalability, performance, and control. To make the best decision for our project, we need to consider the following information:

- Our project requirements and goals, such as the size, scope, complexity, and duration of our project, and the expected outcomes and deliverables.

- Our budget and resources, such as the amount of money, time, and personnel we can allocate to our project, and the trade-offs we are willing to make.

- Our security and compliance needs, such as the level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and systems, and the regulations and standards we need to follow.

- Our scalability and performance expectations, such as the level of demand, traffic, and load of our project, and the quality and speed of our service.
